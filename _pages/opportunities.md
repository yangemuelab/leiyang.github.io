  Our group is diverse and has broad research interests. We do basic to applied research, which means we foucs on the fundamentals, physics and mechanisms which can be applied to real-world applications. In our group, we respect each member's research interests and pride ourselves on being high supportive of each other. 

  We are always looking for talented and outstanding master and doctoral students, postdoctoral research fellows and senior researchers to join us. The potenial candidates should have solid background either on <strong>solid mechanics, computational modeling, artificial intelligence, or mechanical testing</strong>. Note that I am not a hands-on person, so you need to be very self-motivated. I am also not a experimentalist, but mechanical testing is always very important in discovering mechanims, calibrating and validating modeling results.
  
  Academia is not the only goal in our group, we are also very welcome students who want to pursue a career in industry. If you are interested in joining us, please feel free to reach out together with your CV and brief research statement.
