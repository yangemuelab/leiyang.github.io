  Welcome to the EMUE Lab in the College of Civil and Transportation Engineering at Shenzhen University. Our mission is to <strong>see, understand, predict, and design the behavior of structural materials (rocks, concrete, and high-performance composites) under extreme loading conditions</strong>, through a combination of experiments, physics-based theoretical and computational modeling, artifical intelligence, and additive manufacturing. Our goal is to ensure the success and safety of real-world applications in critical sectors where extreme loading scenarios prevail. We are particularly interested in applying our foundamental research to <strong>underground engineering</strong>, but our research also has wide applications in defense, energy, and space. You can explore our current work on our <a href="/research/">Research</a> and <a href="/publications/">Publications</a> pages.
